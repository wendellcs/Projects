### What I learned

At the beginning of this challenge, it was a little difficult to understand the correct sizes of the boxes. However, I made it to the end of the project.
I learned new ways of creating a responsive menu for different screen sizes. It was the first time I made a menu like this, and I found it really fun to do.
